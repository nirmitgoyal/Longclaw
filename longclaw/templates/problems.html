          Burmese refugees in a camp in Thailand
          The Gateway Protection Programme is operated by the British government in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and co-funded by the European Union, offering a legal route for a quota of UNHCR-identified refugees to settle in the United Kingdom. It was proposed by the British Home Secretary, David Blunkett, in October 2001, and its legal basis was established by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The programme launched in March 2004, initially with a quota of 500 and later 750 refugees per year, but the actual number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. As of 2012, refugees of 12 different nationalities had been resettled, with the largest groups being Iraqis, Congolese, Ethiopians, Burmese and Somalis, and 18 of the UK's 434 local authorities had participated as resettlement locations. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.
